    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        I want to become a developer because I'm passionate about creating innovative solutions and solving real-world problems through technology. Software development allows me to bring my ideas to life, whether it's developing web applications, mobile apps, or software tools that can make a difference in people's lives.
        <br><br>
        I'm excited about the endless possibilities that the world of coding offers. It's a constantly evolving field where I can continue to learn and grow, and I find the process of learning new programming languages and frameworks to be both challenging and rewarding.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, the collaborative nature of software development appeals to me. I enjoy working in teams, brainstorming ideas, and collectively building solutions that can have a positive impact on society.
        <br><br>
        Overall, I believe that becoming a developer is not just about writing code; it's about being a part of a creative and dynamic community that has the potential to shape the future.
